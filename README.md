# Zomato-based-site
This (college) project was done to learn the working of a site with its technical requirements.
Well you want to see how zomato may work for admin side?, this is it.
The database is fiction based and created by us(group for the project).
This site has backend based on wamp server so to connect with quries the server should be online.
This project helps in developing  skills for connection between front-end, back-end and the database.


<h1>Future Work</h1>
The front and back work can be made better, also the database will be changed and more functionalities will be added.
